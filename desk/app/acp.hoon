::  acp: generic ship-side transport for Agent Client Protocol
::
::    ACP is bidirectional JSON-RPC. This agent deliberately treats every
::    envelope as opaque NDJSON text so protocol negotiation, extensions, and
::    future versions pass through unchanged. It provides durable ordered queues;
::    a local process only has to translate Eyre subscribe/poke traffic to
::    the adapter's newline-delimited stdio stream.
